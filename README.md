# MetFlix Application Architecture Documentation

## 1. HomeUIM

### 1.1 Overview

The `HomeUIM` module continues to play a vital role in the MetFlix application, representing and managing UI models for various sections in the home view. This update introduces new data models related to channels, series, and courses, enhancing the capabilities of the Home module.

### 1.2 `HomeSectionUIM` Enumeration

#### 1.2.1 DataModelType

- The `DataModelType` struct now includes properties for episodes, channels, categories, and errors.

#### 1.2.2 Cases

- Additional cases such as `Series`, `Course`, `Channel`, `ChannelsApiData`, `Channels`, `Asset`, `Category`, `CategoriesApiData`, `Categories`, `EpisodeMedia`, `CoverAsset`, `EpisodeChannel`, `EpisodesApiData`, and `Episode` have been introduced.

#### 1.2.3 Initialization

- The `init(dataModel:)` initializer has been updated to handle the new data model structures, allowing seamless construction of `HomeSectionUIM` based on the provided `DataModelType`.

#### 1.2.4 `isSameSection(_:)` Function

- The `isSameSection(_ section:)` function remains a vital part of the module, facilitating comparison between different sections.

### 1.3 Extension: `Identifiable`

- The extension ensuring conformance to the `Identifiable` protocol has been kept intact, providing a unique identifier for each case.

### 1.4 Conclusion

- The `HomeUIM` module evolves to accommodate additional data models, maintaining a modular and scalable approach to UI architecture.

## 2. HomeAbstract

### 2.1 Overview

- The `HomeAbstract` module remains the architectural backbone of the Home module, defining abstract protocols for UI modeling, view modeling, services, and cache management.

### 2.2 `UIModeling` Protocol

- The `UIModeling` protocol, conforming to `core_architecture`'s `UIModel` protocol, reflects the evolution of the data models introduced in the `HomeUIM` module.

### 2.3 `HomeViewModeling` Protocol

- The `HomeViewModeling` protocol now incorporates the updated `HomeSectionUIM` cases, providing a structure for managing sections, handling appearance, and refreshing.

### 2.4 `HomeModuling`, `HomeViewProtocol`, `ViewModuling`

- These protocols for modular architecture in the Home module are kept consistent, ensuring conformity to `core_architecture`'s protocols for view moduling.

### 2.5 Specialized Modules and Protocols

- Specialized protocols such as `EpisodesModuling`, `EpisodesViewProtocol`, `EpisodesViewModeling`, `CategoriesModuling`, `CategoriesViewProtocol`, `CategoriesViewModeling`, `ChannelsModuling`, `ChannelsViewProtocol`, and `ChannelsViewModeling` remain integral for specific sections within the Home module.

### 2.6 `ServiceProtocol`

- The abstract `ServiceProtocol` defines services for movie-related operations, maintaining conformity to `core_architecture`'s service protocol with asynchronous methods.

### 2.7 Specialized Service Protocols

- Specialized service protocols such as `MindValleyServiceProtocol`, `EpisodeServiceProtocol`, `ChannelServiceProtocol`, `CategoriesServiceProtocol`, and `ImageDownloadingProtocol` are kept in line with the requirements of the MetFlix application.

### 2.8 `CacheManagerProtocol`

- The `CacheManagerProtocol` continues to define cache management operations, aligning with `core_architecture`'s cache manager protocol.

### 2.9 Conclusion

- The `HomeAbstract` module remains a robust foundation for the Home module, incorporating the latest updates in data models and maintaining a consistent and scalable architecture.
